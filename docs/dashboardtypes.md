#Dashboard Types
 
 
For different types of apps, different types of Dashboards can be the most valuable. Here is a handy aggregation of our thoughts on how to best select what Dashboard you should be using. 
 
We make it really easy to setup your teacher valued metrics and analytics with the appropriate Dashboards for your learning app. Just tell us what sort of app you have. We have dashboards for three common types of apps as explained below.

1. Score based exercises
2. Fact memorisation
3. Level progression

Your application may fit more than one of these categories, in which case you should probably pick the first to appear in the list above. If your application doesn’t fit one of these types, just let us know and we’ll try and create a dashboard just for you!

###**Score based exercises**
####Key metrics: Score achieved for each exercise
 
This type of application has a number of exercises for the learner to do and with each exercise the learner will get a score. Usually the learner will be able to repeat the exercise in order to get a better score.
 
A very common type of score based exercise is a test with multiple-choice questions and apps of this type typically have a number of such tests for different areas of knowledge in the subject that the app is helping to teach. For example a Maths app for primary school children might have tests for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
The key metric that is used for learners, teachers and parents in apps with score based exercises is the best score for each exercise.

###**Fact memorisation**
####Key metrics: Number of facts memorised and how well the facts are memorised for each group of facts
 
Fact memorisation apps aim to help learn and memorise facts. The key metric in such apps is how many facts the learner has memorised.
 
Vocabulary learning apps for foreign languages are a common type of fact memorisation application. Similarly applications that aim to teach geography or history are often about memorising facts. Such applications are sometimes implemented as virtual flash cards and typically use spaced repetition algorithms to optimise the rate at which learners memorise facts (you can use our own spaced repetition algorithms in your app if you like!).
Fact memorisation apps typically have a measure for each fact as to how well the learner has memorised that fact. This may be as simple as the number of times that the learner has correctly recalled the answer.
 
Note that your application may be testing how well learners have memorised facts, but that you may have implemented it as a set of score based exercises. If so, you can choose how to configure the dashboards and analytics for your application.

###**Level progression**
####Key metrics: Level reached and time taken to complete each exercise
 
In some learning applications, there is no score per se, the learner has either completed (or solved) the exercise or they have not. Quite often there is a specific goal to be reached in completing the level. In such applications the learner typically is not allowed to move onto the next exercise until they have solved the previous exercise and the exercises are typically presented as “levels”.
Games such as candy crush and angry birds are level progression apps (though they have limited educational value!). Applications that teach coding are quite often level progression as there is typically a goal to be reached.
 
Level progression apps are sometimes implemented as score based exercises by giving learners a score for each level. If there is a natural score that is computed from each exercise, then you probably want to provide these scores in the dashboard as a measure of learner ability and specify this app as a score based exercise app. If, however, there is no natural score associated with each exercise, then time to complete the exercise is likely to be the most appropriate way to give further insight on a learner’s ability and by specifying your app to be a level progression app we automatically will provide dashboards and analytics that show how long learners have taken to complete exercises.
